## Dataset
> We used data for restaurants from https://www.yelp.com/dataset to analyze 100 restaurants across 13 states in the U.S.  Since restaurants make up a good percentage of businesses in the U.S., it is worth looking into why restaurants close, whether reviews/stars given on Yelp are correlated with closing a restaurant down, and other questions!
