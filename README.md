# INFO-2950-Project
## Dataset
> We used data for restaurants from https://www.yelp.com/dataset to analyze popular restaurants on 2nd Ave in Nashville, TN.  2nd Ave is a historic tourist spot, so it is worth looking into why restaurants closed, whether reviews/stars given on Yelp are correlated with closing a restaurant down, and other questions!
